This is a web-based memory game where the player has to match pairs of cards with the same image. It was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Gameplay
* The game consists of a deck of cards with different images on the back.
* The cards are arranged face down, and the player must flip them over to reveal the image on the front.
* The player must then try to find the matching card with the same image as the first card they flipped.
* If the cards match, they will remain face up, and the player will earn points.
* If the cards do not match, they will be flipped back over, and the player will lose points.
* The game continues until all pairs have been matched.
